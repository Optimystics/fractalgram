# Telegram Web Z

This project won the first prize ðŸ¥‡ at [Telegram Lightweight Client Contest](https://contest.com/javascript-web-3) and now is an official Telegram client available to anyone at [web.telegram.org/z](https://web.telegram.org/z).

This is a fork of [Telegram Web Z](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt), which adds some additional features to help run [Eden](https://www.edenelections.com/) / [Fractally](https://fractally.com/) style meetings. Specifically it adds some buttons to automate creation of polls and other kinds of messages which help reach consensus in these meetings.

[See introductory post for details](https://peakd.com/dao/@sim31/introducing-fractalgram).

## Local setup

mv .env.example .env
