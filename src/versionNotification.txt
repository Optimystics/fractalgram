https://peakd.com/dao/@sim31/introducing-fractalgram

**Changes from the original [Telegram Web Z client](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt):**
• Added additional buttons in attachment menu which automate creation of messages relevant for consensus building in Eden / Fractal style meetings.
  • Polls for ranking contributions of break-out room participants.
  • Poll for electing a delegate of a break-out group.
  • A message which summarizes results from the polls.
  • A message to prompt for account names of external platform (like EOS blockchain) ("account prompt messsage").
• Replies to "account prompt message" and information derived from the polls are used to generate a url, which participants can use to post results to the blockchain. This URL can optionally be shown as part of results message.
